# Sentiment_Analysis-WEBAPP
Using VADERSentiment to asses the sentiment in text sent from the reader.


Sentiment analysis, an important area in Natural Language Processing, is the process of automatically detecting affective states of text.

VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned 
to sentiments expressed in social media, and works well on texts from other domains.

To be able to run the .py file you need to have the following libraries installed
